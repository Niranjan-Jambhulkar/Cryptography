The Caesar Cipher is a simple yet fascinating encryption technique that dates back to ancient times. It was famously used by Julius Caesar to send secret messages to his allies. Let’s dive into the details:

**What is the Caesar Cipher?**
The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext message is replaced by a letter with a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
For example, with a shift of 1, ‘A’ becomes ‘B,’ ‘B’ becomes ‘C,’ and so on.
The method is named after Julius Caesar, who employed it for secure communication.

**How Does It Work?**
To encrypt a given text, we need an integer value called the shift (or key). This indicates how many positions each letter of the text has been moved down.
The alphabet wraps around, so after ‘Z,’ it starts back at ‘A.’
For example, with a shift of 3:
‘HELLO’ becomes ‘KHOOR.’
To decrypt, we shift each letter back by the same number of positions.

**Advantages:**
Easy to implement: Suitable for beginners to learn about encryption.
Can be physically implemented (e.g., using rotating disks or a scytale).
Requires only a small set of pre-shared information.
Can be modified for added security (multiple shift values or keywords).

**Disadvantages:**
Not secure against modern decryption methods.
Vulnerable to known-plaintext attacks.
Limited keyspace (only 26 possible keys due to the English alphabet).
